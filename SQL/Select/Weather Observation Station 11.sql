SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE (NOT(CITY  Like 'A%' OR CITY LIKE 'E%' OR CITY LIKE 'O%' OR CITY LIKE 'I%' OR CITY LIKE 'U%'))
		OR 
	  (NOT (CITY LIKE '%a' OR CITY  LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' OR CITY LIKE '%u'))
ORDER BY CITY;
		
		
		
		
--MS SQL Server
SELECT DISTINCT(City) FROM STATION WHERE LOWER(City) NOT LIKE '[aeiou]%' OR LOWER(City) NOT LIKE '%[aeiou]';
